c Problem  : Schubert's Steamroller
c Version  : Especial.
c English  : Wolves, foxes, birds, caterpillars, and snails are animals, and
c            there are some of each of them. Also there are some grains, and
c            grains are plants. Every animal either likes to eat all plants
c            or all animals much smaller than itself that like to eat some
c            plants. Caterpillars and snails are much smaller than birds,
c            which are much smaller than foxes, which in turn are much
c            smaller than wolves. Wolves do not like to eat foxes or grains,
c            while birds like to eat caterpillars but not snails.
c            Caterpillars and snails like to eat some plants. Therefore
c            there is an animal that likes to eat a grain eating animal.
